  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I started on my development path in
    <span style="color: #ffcc00">grade 7</span>, launching my first
    <span style="color: #ff6699">Roblox</span> game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite limited knowledge at the time, I wanted to make gameplay unique. Since then, I’ve dedicated countless hours exploring
    and learning to write better code to create better games.
  </p>
  <h2>-</h2>
  <p>
    I achieved over <span style="color: #ffcc00">90,000</span> visits and
    developed more than <span style="color: #ffcc00">200</span> games on
    <span style="color: #ff6699">Roblox</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    During <span style="color: #ffcc00">grades 7</span> through
    <span style="color: #ffcc00">9</span>, I taught myself
    <span style="color: #00ccff">Lua</span> and explored
    <span style="color: #00ccff">C#</span> for Unity development.
  </p>
  <p>
    These experiences gave me a strong command over coding fundamentals, network
    systems, and object-oriented programming—skills I continuously improve.

      <h2>Web Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        In <span style="color: #ffcc00">grade 9</span>, I developed a Discord
        chatbot using the Chai developer API, later upgrading it to
        <span style="color: #ff6699">OpenAI's GPT</span> models.
      </p>
      <p>
        I deployed the bot using platforms like Replit, writing in
        <span style="color: #00ccff">JavaScript</span> and leveraging libraries
        such as <span style="color: #00ccff">Axios</span> and
        <span style="color: #00ccff">node-fetch</span> for seamless API
        integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also created an API that connects JavaScript with
        <span style="color: #00ccff">Python</span>, allowing me to use Hugging
        Face for AI image generation.

      <h2>High School Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        Graduating from
        <span style="color: #00ffcc">Holy Trinity Academy</span> as a top
        performer in computer programming, I created a
        <span style="color: #00ccff">C++</span> program to aid in my school’s
        graduation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work demonstrated my proficiency in
        <span style="color: #00ccff">C++</span>, mastering key areas like linear
        data structures, recursion, algorithms, and hash tables.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m always ready to bring that same drive and expertise into any project
        I take on.
